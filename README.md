## 📌 Overview

**CoviCare** is a full-stack web application developed during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic to support **home-quarantined patients** by monitoring their vital signs—especially **SpO2 (oxygen saturation)**—and generating real-time alerts upon detecting abnormal levels. The application was designed to bridge the gap between remote patients and medical professionals, helping provide timely intervention in critical cases.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Enable real-time monitoring of vital signs for COVID-19 patients in isolation.
- Automatically trigger alerts when SpO2 readings fall below critical thresholds.
- Present health data visually for quick decision-making by caregivers and patients.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap 4
- **Visualization**: Chart.js
- **Backend/Data Handling**: Python (BeautifulSoup for web scraping)
- **Version Control**: GitHub

## 🧠 Key Features

- 🔍 Scrapes live COVID-19 stats using **BeautifulSoup**, keeping the dashboard updated.
- 📊 Uses **Chart.js** to display real-time vitals in a clear, accessible format.
- 🚨 Implements an **automated alert system** for SpO2 anomalies.
- 💻 Built with **responsive design** principles using Bootstrap for mobile and desktop.
- 👨‍🔬 Clinical thresholds validated in collaboration with healthcare professionals.
- 🧑‍💼 Developed under mentorship of Prof. Deepak Vegda, mirroring real-world agile workflows.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User logs in and begins real-time SpO2 monitoring.
2. System fetches patient vitals, visualizes them using Chart.js.
3. If abnormal readings are detected, alerts are triggered for intervention.
4. All health records are updated dynamically via integrated APIs and web scraping.
